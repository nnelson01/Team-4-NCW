**Each of us has uploaded a solution within our designtaed folders.**

We began each problem by working together to map the logic of each solution, then pair-programmed it. Oftentimes we found it more helpful to begin 
developing our own solutions then comparing notes with each other along the way.

Each answer should be equivalent to the others but our methods are varied across each task.
