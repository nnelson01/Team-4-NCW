This class has been an excellent introduction to both Python and options pricing. I agree with your statement at the beginning of the semester, though: the class will be greatly improved once the proper prerequisites are in place--asserting an essential knowledge of Python as a gateway to the course. This is essential as I feel the first half of the semester was certainly more slow-paced while the last half became a break-neck introduction to pricing models. With a full semester to explore the core material, I expect future students will develop a much more thorough understanding of it.

However, I feel quite satisfied with the outcome as-is. Despite having never programmed in Python before this class (and the introductory nature of our lessons) I was able to carry that knowledge forward into other projects surprisingly well. By November, I had developed an online application written in Python that is capable of making multiple API calls, secure-token verification, and an interactive bot-user. Furthermore, I thoroughly enjoyed our discussions about pricing theory--though I must admit that the equations can be quite daunting. It would be an overstatement to say that I fully understand the relationships between them all, but I can comfortably say that I understand the essential theory of extrapolating payoffs and prices from a binomial tree.
